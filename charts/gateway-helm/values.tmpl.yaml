# -- Certgen is used to generate the certificates required by EnvoyGateway. If you want to construct a custom certificate, you can generate a custom certificate through Cert-Manager before installing EnvoyGateway. Certgen will not overwrite the custom certificate. Please do not manually modify `values.yaml` to disable certgen, it may cause EnvoyGateway OIDC,OAuth2,etc. to not work as expected.
